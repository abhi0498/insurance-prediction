  <h2 style="color:blue">Linear Regression</h2>
  <p>
    <ul>In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a scalar response (or
      dependent variable) and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables). The case of one explanatory
      variable is called simple linear regression.
      In linear regression, the relationships are modeled using linear predictor functions whose unknown model
      parameters are estimated from the data. Such models are called linear models.[3] Most commonly, the conditional
      mean of the response given the values of the explanatory variables (or predictors) is assumed to be an affine
      function of those values; less commonly, the conditional median or some other quantile is used. Like all forms of
      regression analysis, linear regression focuses on the conditional probability distribution of the response given
      the values of the predictors, rather than on the joint probability distribution of all of these variables, which
      is the domain of multivariate analysis.

  <h2>Decision tree Regression</h2>
  <p>
    Decision tree builds regression or classification models in the form of a tree structure. It breaks down a dataset
    into smaller and smaller subsets while at the same time an associated decision tree is incrementally developed. The
    final result is a tree with decision nodes and leaf nodes. A decision node (e.g., Outlook) has two or more branches
    (e.g., Sunny, Overcast and Rainy), each representing values for the attribute tested. Leaf node (e.g., Hours Played)
    represents a decision on the numerical target. The topmost decision node in a tree which corresponds to the best
    predictor called root node. Decision trees can handle both categorical and numerical data.

  <h2>Random Forest</h2>
  <p> Random forests or random decision forests are an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other
    tasks that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is
    the mode of the classes or mean prediction of the individual trees</p>
